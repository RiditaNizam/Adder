# Adder

The goal of this app is to be able to send and recieve data between two intents.

I create an app called Adder with two activities.

The Main activity has two number inputs and a "SUM" button.

When user types in two numbers and presses the SUM button, a new activity is launched.

It displays the sum of the numbers from the previous activity.
